# SCA-Cloud-School-Application
My Technical Assessment for SheCodeAfrica Cloud School.
Steps on how i created my CLI Application
1 i opened a github repository
2 i searched how to create a CLI App (Since i have no idea)
3 i opned my terminal and typed 'cd Desktop'.
4 i clicked on code and copied the HTTPS link and used the command as directed in the video "clone 'the link i copied'" and cloned my repository, then used the command "cd 'my copied link'/"
5 i added a README by typing "touch README.md then vi README.md and that's how i could write this now. to exit this part i will press 'esc key, :wq!' and will go back to my CLI.
